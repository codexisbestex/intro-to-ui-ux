## [Beginner's Guide to Wireframing for Website Design](https://www.flux-academy.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-wireframing-for-website-design)

- The layout of the wireframe (header, body, footer and what each section contains within)
- Image boxes represented by boxes with an X in them
- Labeling through your content as necessary
- A good wireframe enables the designer of the site to express their vision for the site most accurately in the minimum necessary terms
- No explicit labels in wireframe (clean wireframe)
- Wireframes don't apply specifics like color schemes, image choice, and specific site content (those 3 elements appear instead in a high-fidelity prototype)
